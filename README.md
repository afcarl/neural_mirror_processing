# Neural Mirror 

A  mirror  where people look into a camera and the display renders their image in different  hallucinations and styles using artificial neural networks. Each AI rendered image represents a different emotional state that the person sees themselves through: anger, sadness, shock,disgust, using different colors ,styles, and hallucinations.  


##Built With
Processing,tensorflow via API, and a webcam where the main tools used to build this.

I worked on and displayed this during my residency at SFPC.
